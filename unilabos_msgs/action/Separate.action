# Organic
string purpose  # 'wash' or 'extract'. 'wash' means that product phase will not be the added solvent phase, 'extract' means product phase will be the added solvent phase. If no solvent is added just use 'extract'.
string product_phase # 'top' or 'bottom'. Phase that product will be in.
string from_vessel #Contents of from_vessel are transferred to separation_vessel and separation is performed.
string separation_vessel # Vessel in which separation of phases will be carried out.
string to_vessel # Vessel to send product phase to.
string waste_phase_to_vessel # Optional. Vessel to send waste phase to.
string solvent # Optional. Solvent to add to separation vessel after contents of from_vessel has been transferred to create two phases.
float64 solvent_volume # Optional. Volume of solvent to add.
string through # Optional. Solid chemical to send product phase through on way to to_vessel, e.g. 'celite'.
int32 repeats # Optional. Number of separations to perform.
float64 stir_time # Optional. Time stir for after adding solvent, before separation of phases.
float64 stir_speed # Optional. Speed to stir at after adding solvent, before separation of phases.
float64 settling_time # Optional. Time
